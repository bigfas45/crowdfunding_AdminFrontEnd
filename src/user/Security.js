          <p style={{fontWeight: "bolder", fontSize: "18px"}}>NASD Crowdy Portal takes cyber security and digital resilience seriously. We understand our users always expect our services to be available and their data to be kept secure. We work hard to manage security risks and stay ahead of possible threats by maintaining focus on the following areas.</p>

         
       

             <p class=""><span class="text-primary"  style={{fontWeight: "bolder", fontSize: "18px"}}>1. Secure code development</span> <br/>

           <span style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>We have a high-availability solution that protects our infrastructure against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

We also have an internal vulnerability management process with automatic scanning capabilities.</span></p>


             <p class=""><span class="text-primary"  style={{fontWeight: "bolder", fontSize: "18px"}}>6. Third party security</span><br/>

We ensure that third parties are properly assessed in line with our security, outsourcing and data residency policies and procedures, and reviewed on a regular basis.</span></p>


             <p class=""><span class="text-primary"  style={{fontWeight: "bolder", fontSize: "18px"}}>7. Incident and vulnerability reporting</span><br/>
