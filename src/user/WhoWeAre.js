         <p class="lead"><span style={{fontWeight: "bolder"}}> NASD VentureRamp</span> is focused on connecting entrepreneurs and investors and creating the basis for promising business ideas together.</p>


         <p class="lead"> We believe that economic growth and expansion lies in the hands of young and innovative MSMEs. Historically access to finance has been identified as a major impediment to the growth and development of these enterprises. Therefore, we have made it our goal to support these entrepreneurs in laying the foundations required for the realisation of their dreams.</p>


         <p class="lead"> Through NASD VentureRamp, we are bridging the financing gap experienced by MSMEs and mitigating the challenges encountered when applying to access capital from traditional providers of capital. In addition, NASD VentureRamp provides a unique avenue for individuals to invest in enterprises and ideas in which they believe show a promising potential for growth. </p>
